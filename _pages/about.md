## 研究重点

- **大模型与商业计算 LLMs and Business Computation:**
  - 专注于利用大语言模型（LLMs）来增强商业计算的能力。LLMs在文本分析、自然语言理解和生成方面的能力，对于战略决策和运营效率至关重要。我的研究旨在通过这些先进的语言处理技术，将数据转化为可操作的商业洞察。
  - Specializing in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance capabilities in business computation. The capabilities of LLMs in text analysis, natural language understanding, and generation are pivotal for strategic decision-making and operational efficiency. My research aims to transform data into actionable business insights through these advanced language processing technologies.

- **AI在社会科学中的应用 AI for Social Science:**
  - 探索人工智能技术在社会科学中的应用，旨在通过建模和解释社会现象，增强我们在社会领域的预测和解释能力。
  - Exploring the application of artificial intelligence technologies in social science, aiming to enhance our predictive and explanatory power in the social domain by modeling and interpreting social phenomena.

- **网络科学 Network Science:**
  - 研究复杂网络的结构属性及其对各种社会、经济和技术系统的影响。
  - Investigating the structural properties of complex networks and their implications for various social, economic, and technological systems.

- **智能决策与神经经济学 Intelligent Decision-making and Neuroeconomics:**
  - 从事决策的认知过程研究和智能系统开发，帮助提高商业中人的决策能力。
  - Engaged in the study of cognitive processes in decision-making and the development of intelligent systems that can augment human decision-making capabilities.
